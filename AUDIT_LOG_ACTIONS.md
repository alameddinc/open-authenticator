Action filter: "api_key_"

# View security-sensitive operations
Action filter: "delete" or "created" or "updated"
```

### By Resource
```
# View all operations on specific account
Resource filter: "account_5"

# View all operations on specific API key
Resource filter: "api_key_3"

# View all auth operations
Resource filter: "auth"
```

### By Username
```

## Security Monitoring Scenarios

### 1. Detect Unauthorized Access Attempts
```
Filter: action = "login_failed"
Alert when: Multiple failed attempts from same username (>5 in 10 minutes)
```

### 2. Track TOTP Code Access
```
Filter: action = "totp_viewed"
Purpose: See who viewed which TOTP codes
Alert when: Unusual access patterns or after-hours access
```

### 3. Monitor Account Deletions
```
Filter: action contains "deleted"
Purpose: Track all deletion operations
Alert when: Multiple deletions in short timeframe
```

### 4. API Key Management Audit
```
Filter: action contains "api_key"
Purpose: Track API key lifecycle
Alert when: Key created with no expiration or deactivated unexpectedly
```

### 5. Privilege Escalation Detection
```
Filter: action = "user_role_changed"
Purpose: Monitor role changes
Alert when: Non-admin user role changed to admin
```

## Compliance Scenarios

### ISO 27001 / KVKK Compliance
```
Requirement: Access control audit trail
Filters:
  - action = "login_success" OR "login_failed"
  - action = "totp_viewed"
  - action contains "user_"
Retention: 30 days minimum (currently configured)
```

### Data Access Tracking
```
Requirement: Who accessed what data when
Filters:
  - action = "totp_viewed" (sensitive data access)
  - action = "backup_downloaded" (bulk data export)
  - resource = specific account ID
```

### Administrative Actions Audit
```
Requirement: Track privileged operations
Filters:
  - username = "admin" or role = "admin"
  - action contains "created" OR "deleted" OR "updated"
  - Date range: Monthly reports
```

## Integration with External Systems

### SIEM Integration
Export audit logs via API:
```bash
curl -X GET "https://totp.trt.net.tr/api/audit?startDate=1633046400&endDate=1633132800" \
  -H "Cookie: session=YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### Automated Alerts
Monitor specific actions programmatically:
```bash
# Check for failed login attempts
curl "https://totp.trt.net.tr/api/audit?action=login_failed&limit=100"

# Check TOTP views in last hour
HOUR_AGO=$(date -u -d '1 hour ago' +%s)
NOW=$(date -u +%s)
curl "https://totp.trt.net.tr/api/audit?action=totp_viewed&startDate=$HOUR_AGO&endDate=$NOW"
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Regular Audit Reviews
- Daily: Review failed login attempts
- Weekly: Review account/user creation and deletions
- Monthly: Comprehensive compliance report

### 2. Retention Policy
- Current setting: 30 days
- Recommendation: Export critical logs for long-term storage before deletion
- Compliance: Adjust based on regulatory requirements (GDPR: up to 6 years)

### 3. Alert Configuration
- Failed logins: > 5 attempts in 10 minutes per user
- After-hours access: TOTP views outside business hours
- Bulk operations: > 10 accounts created/deleted in 1 hour
- Privilege changes: Any role escalation

### 4. Access Control
- Only admins can view audit logs
- Audit logs themselves are audited (users:list action)
- No audit log modification capability (append-only)
